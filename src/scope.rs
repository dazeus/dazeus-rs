/// consists of three different elements:
///
/// * The `network` indicates for which network some property or permission should be stored.
/// * The `sender` indicates the IRC user for which some property or permission should be stored.
/// * The `receiver` indicates the channel for which some property or permission should be stored.
///
/// Note that for a sender or receiver scope, you also should provide a network, as it makes no
/// sense to for example provide a permission to the same channel on different networks (they are
/// only the same in name, but might be completely different in context).
///
/// The most generic scope (and easiest one to start with) is one applied to everything. Such a
/// scope can be created by the `Scope::any()` method.
